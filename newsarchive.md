Two senior students from our laboratory (Mr. K. Elibol and Mr. G. Atmaca) got 1st and 2nd places in a competition with the projects studied in our laboratory. Competition was for physics senior students and held at Bilkent University at May 15th, 2010. Mr. K. Elibol's study was about numerical optimization and device characterization of AlGaN/GaN based HEMT structure with InGaN back barriers. Mr. G. Atmaca's study was about numerical optimization of Double AlInN barrier for GaN-based HEMT structures. Congratulations folks!
