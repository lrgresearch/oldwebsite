## About

Low-dimensional Materials and Systems (LRG) is a research group studying the physics of semiconductor or dielectric materials with a low-dimensionality involves. For this, the effects of defects, impurities and low-dimensional shapes are investigated. As material groups, we are interested in GaN-based materials, ZnO-based materials, Carbon allotropes and Carbon-based structures (graphene, diamond and SiC) and black phosphorus. 

LRG is located at Laboratory Building, Faculty of Science at Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.
